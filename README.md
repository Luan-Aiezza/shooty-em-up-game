# shooty-em-up-game
This is a "shoot em up" game based on another game called Touhou (2001), I adapted the game to league C# in Unity for the new generation of indie games.

NT: this is just a beta game of a stage in the boss battle

# rules
My game was programmed by Unity in C# scripts, so I need all the tools below to run it in Unity or edit it.

# what I need?
you need:

1 - Unity and Unity Hub

2 - Visual Studio Code

3 - C# Extension for Visual Studio Code

4 - Unity libraries import

# how to run
Just install Unity, and look for the option in unity hub to open a project folder, good game! ;D
